# Georoc_Geochem_Project

### Rock classification models using ML

Two projects based on the Georoc geochemical database of volcanic rocks are in progress: 1) prediction of initial SiO2 and K2O+Na2O in altered volcanic rocks for a TAS diagram adapted to altered rocks (Antoine); and 2) classification of the geotectonic setting of volcanic rocks.
